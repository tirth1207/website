In 2024, I made a decision that most people wouldn’t dare to consider:  
I dropped out of 11th Science.

Not because I couldn’t keep up—  
but because I couldn’t keep pretending that the conventional path was enough.

I didn’t want to just *study* how the world works.  
I wanted to **engineer** the world I imagined.

So I made the leap.  
From textbooks to terminals. From memorizing to making.

I enrolled in a diploma in computer engineering and set out to architect my own education—designing, debugging, deploying, and dreaming without limits.
